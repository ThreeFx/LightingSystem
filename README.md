## LightingSystem

My CERN internship project

Set up a system to check the lighting power of lamps after being exposed to raditation.
Also do a similar test on glass, determining how the colors change.

### Usage

1. Upload the program to the correctly plugged Arduino
2. Connect it to the sensors via cables / pins
3. Connect it to the USB port of the logging machine
4. Run the `transform.py` program to log the results
